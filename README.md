Use Bayesian Global Optimization to Solve Inverse Problems
======================================================================

This package contains examples of application of Bayesian Global Optimization
(BGO) to the solution of inverse problems.

The code is developed by the
[Predictive Science Laboratory (PSL)](http://www.predictivesciencelab.org) at
Purdue University.

Contents
--------

We give a brief description of what is in each file/folder of this code.
For more details, you are advised to look at the extensive comments.

* [plots.py](./plots.py):
Includes routines that make the plots you see.

* [pydes](./pydes):
This is a Python module that implements BGO.
It will be a separate fully functional module in the near future.

Dependencies
------------

Before trying to use the code, you should install the following dependencies:
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)
* [seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/)
* [GPy](https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy)

Installation
------------

There is nothing to install. You can just use the code once you enter the code
directory. [pydes](./pydes) can be used as an independent python module if you
add it to your PYTHONPATH. However, this is not necessary if all you want to
do is run the demos.
